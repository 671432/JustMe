# JustMe

Website: https://671432.github.io/JustMe/

# info

just creating a little portfolio website to show who I am and what projects I have worked on.

# Known issues

- some styling aspects of the buttons aren't being applied on iOS devices
- copy/pasting the link to anything other then "671432.github.io/JustMe/" results in a page not found error ( for example: "671432.github.io/JustMe/projects" results in an error)
- SVGR module is installed but not properly configured for ReactComponent imports.

# Planned work

- improove the styling for the page titles
- add some fx
- add icon to the frameworks section
- fix the "Socials" page
- make the project page scroll animation smoother
- cleanup code (remove unused styling, combine repeating styles)
- "redesign" .css to be more consistant and automated
- add proper comments to code (docs)

# Noteworthy updates after initial publishing

- refactored the projects page to use a "scroll snapping" layout
- replaced the placeholder images
- added a link to the website title that goes to the homepage
- made the bottom part of the hero image scroll with the navbar (removed)
- added a layout for mobile devices (changes depending on screen width)
- styling of the background is now being applied to embeded pages and iOS devices
- fixed scaling for mobile devices after changing project dropdown size (dropdown menu removed in favor of scroll snapping layout)
- changed the styling to have a better "pop" factor
- add icons to social page buttons
- added feature to click on project images to show a larger version
