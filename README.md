# JustMe

Website: https://671432.github.io/JustMe/

# info

just creating a little portfolio website to show who I am and what projects I have worked on.

# Known issues

- styling of the buttons isn't being applied on iOS devices
- copy/pasting the link to anything other then "671432.github.io/JustMe/" results in a page not found error ( for example: 671432.github.io/JustMe/projects results in an error)

# Planned work

- improove the styling for the page titles
- increase page title size
- add "something" (animation, images, dunno) on both sides of the title for bedazzeling.
- fix the dropdown and image sizing
- add some fx (steam card hover)
- add icon above the dropdown relating to the project (G Major Key for frequency project, etc)
- decrease dropdown bar lenght
- add fancy things on the side of the dropdowns that relates to the chosen project
- add an option to change the dropdown layout (side by side, 1by1, etc)
- fix the "Socials" page

# Idea dump

- change the project page to use animations and fully change the window on every scroll to reflect each project individually (new background image, condense everything to fitt inside the screen)

# Noteworthy updates after initial publishing

- replaced the placeholder images
- added a link to the website title that goes to the homepage
- made the bottom part of the hero image scroll with the navbar
- added a layout for mobile devices (changes depending on screen width)
- styling of the background is now being applied to embeded pages and potentially also iOS devices
