# JustMe

Website: https://671432.github.io/JustMe/

# info

just creating a little portfolio website to show who I am and what projects I have worked on.

# Known issues

- styling isn't being applied on iOS devices
- copy/pasting the link to anything other then "671432.github.io/JustMe/" results in a page not found error ( for example: 671432.github.io/JustMe/projects results in an error)

# Planned work

- make the bottom part of the hero image scroll with the navbar
- add a link to the website title that goes to the homepage
- improove the styling for the page titles
- add a layout for mobile devices

# Noteworthy updates after initial publishing

- replace the placeholder images
