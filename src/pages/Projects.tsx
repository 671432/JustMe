        This Project page doesn't have every project I've worked on, it just has
        what I feel has enough work put into it to be presentable to others. A
        few of my projects are made in a very confusing way since I never
        planned on releasing them thus not needing to make them understandable
        to anyone besides myself ;)

        I'll add better descriptions/info to the projects once I got some more
        time.
