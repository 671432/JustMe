        This page is still a work in progress and will be updated... eventually.

      <p>Who am I?</p>
      <p>
        Just a normal nerdy guy who figured out in 2019 that programing wasn't
        as boring as he first thought, and learned more and more about how much
        fun it is to me to just try and brake programs, see how far I can get
        (without this having negative impacts on others). I also enjoy simply
        helping others when they have problems with things I know something
        about, I'm a pretty reserved person so I don't tend to immediately offer
        my help, but I usually help troubleshooting the second I'm asked, not
        for validation, but because I enjoy fixing problems as well as being
        able to understand more about how something works in the background.

      <p>What I do? </p>
      <p>
        I tend to stick my nose into almost everything tech related, be it as
        simple as a 2005 desktop being slow and it most likely just being an
        outdated hardware issue, all the way to the newest most sci-fi looking
        technological wonders I have ever seen, and this applies to both
        hardware and software; if a program uses some new innovative visuals or
        it runs super smooth when it shouldn't be able to do so, I get rly
        interested in knowing how it was done.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise I do also enjoy some more "normal" things... like gaming!</p>
      <p>
        I tend to stick to MMO RPGs with action combat like Black Desert Online,
        but recently there haven't been a lot of enjoyable updates, so it's time
        to wait for that new game that is hopefully around the corner.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not playing for a story (otherwise I would be watching a movie
        instead), but I love stunning visuals and smooth gameplay. Loading
        screens are my worst enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also try to complete my embarrassingly large backlog of single player
        games, but I tend to take a longer brake to keep on playing online games
        like Dead by Daylight, Motor Town: Behind The Wheel, Golf it, or
        recently a few rounds of Zombies in Black Ops 3 with my friends.

      <p>My hobbies and some nerd info: </p>
      <p>
        Gaming, Anime, Understanding how games and programs work and trying to
        find exploits or visual bugs, also enjoy creating cheat tables, messing
        with values, finding values, making point maps, etc. highly interested
        in reverse engineering, but so far, only read and watched videos about
        it, not properly attempted it myself. I'm also into street basket and
        parkour although I haven't done either for some time now.
