        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Just a normal nerdy guy who realized in 2019 that programming wasn’t
          as boring as it first seemed. Since then, I’ve enjoyed attempting to
          break systems, exploring limits, and understanding how systems work
          without causing harm to others.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy helping people troubleshoot problems once I’m asked, not for
          validation, but because I genuinely enjoy fixing things and learning
          what’s happening behind the scenes.
        </p>

        <h2>What do I do?</h2>
        <p>
          I stick my nose into almost everything tech related, from diagnosing
          slow old hardware, to being fascinated by cutting-edge software with
          smooth performance or innovative visuals.
        </p>

        <p>If something runs better than it should, I want to know why.</p>
